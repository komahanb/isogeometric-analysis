\section{Introduction and Motivation}
Non-uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) \cite{Piegl:NurbsBook} are a
popular way to represent curves and surfaces in geometry modeling. In
other words, they provide a basis for three-dimensional euclidean
space. In principle, they can be used to span other spaces as well,
for example, N-dimensional vector spaces in finite element
analysis. This realization has led to the development of isogeometric
analysis
(IGA)~\cite{HUGHES20054135,KACPRZYK201487,NGUYEN201589,Agrawal2018,Milic2013,Simpson}
where the same functions used for geometry representation in
$\mathbb{E}^3$ is also used to represent displacement field in
$\mathbb{R}^M$.
IGA is a recently introduced technique that employs the Computer Aided
Design concepts of Non-uniform Rational B-splines(NURBS) tool to
bridge the substantial bottleneck between the CAD and finite element
analysis field. The fundamental concept of IGA is to utilize the NURBS
basis functions not only for the construction or as a handler of the
exact form of CAD geometries, but also as a tool that can be used for
their mathematical analysis.
The importance of IGA is follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item FEM utilizes the approximate form of CAD geometry by discretizing them into a smaller sub-geometry called elements. Whereas in IGA, CAD-based NURBS described geometries are directly employed in the analysis without making any geometrical approximations like in FEM.
  \item IGA reduces the burden of mesh regeneration and thus minimizes the computational cost. % to a great extent.
  \item Due to inherent higher order continuity and exact representation of geometrical features, IGA has been shown to be advantageous in contact, fluid, structural vibration problems and more. 
  \item IGA can be applied to specific problems which have been solved with FEM to attain improved solution.
\end{itemize}
Isogeometric boundary element methods for elastostatic analysis were
presented in [127,118], demonstrating that mesh generation can be
completely circumvented by using CAD discretizations for analysis.
%To describe the application of IGA, a standard infinite plate with a
%circular hole problem in tension as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:iga-demo}
%is chosen.

%  \caption{\emph{NURBS decretized quarter-plate with a hole}}
%  \label{fig:iga-demo}
%\end{figure}
In IGA, apart from the
geometrical details(length, height, width) of a model, its parametric
details such as knot vectors, the order of NURBS basis functions, and
the control points are also needed to construct the exact form of
discretized geometry. The evaluation of NURBS basis functions and
their respective derivatives, along with their corresponding mappings
are need to be done along with the enforcement procedure for different
boundary conditions for NURBS defined geometry.
The main objective of the project is implementation of NURBS based
Isogeometric Analysis(IGA) on test problems.

\section{NURBS representation of Curves and Surfaces}
\subsection{Parametric Representation of Curves}
Let $\vv{p}(u) = [x(u), y(u), z(u)]^T$ refer to the parametric
representation of a point on a curve in three-dimensional Euclidean
space $\mathbb{E}^3$, where $u \in [u_{min}, u_{max}]$ is a scalar
parameter that takes a given range of values to characterize the curve. 
Any point on the curve can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \vv{p}(u) := {\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i N_{k,i}(u) \vv{P}^{i}}/{\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i N_{k,i}(u)} \quad 0 \le u \le n-k+2
\end{equation}
where $k$ refers to the order of the $i-$th BSpline basis functions $N_{k,i}$, 
$\vv{P}^i$ is the $i-$th control point,  $n+1$ is the number of control points
and $\alpha_i$ is the weight associated with $i-th$ control point. 
The inputs required  are 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a given set of $n+1$ control points $\{\vv{P}^i\}_{i=0}^n$ and 
\item chosen order $k$
\item weights $\alpha_i$
\end{enumerate}
Note that the order is chosen independent of the number of control
points. The first-derivative (slope) of the curve at a parametric point $u$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \td{\vv{p}(u)}{u} := \vv{p}^u(u) & = \sum_{i=0}^n  \alpha_i \td{N_{k,i}(u)}{u} \vv{P}^{i} / \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \td{N_{k,i}(u)}{u}  \\ &= \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i N_{k,i}^{u}(u) \vv{P}^{i} /\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i N_{k,i}^{u}(u).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $N_{k,i}^u(u)$ is the u-derivative of the corresponding basis
function. Here, we simply use the fact that only the basis function is
dependent on the parameter $u$. This naturally extends to second-order
derivatives (curvature) as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \tdt{\vv{p}(u)}{u} := \vv{p}^{uu}(u) & = \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \tdt{N_{k,i}(u)}{u} \vv{P}^{i}/\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \tdt{N_{k,i}(u)}{u} \\ & = \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i N_{k,i}^{uu}(u) \vv{P}^{i}/\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i N_{k,i}^{uu}(u).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We note the following important properties of the Bspline curve:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The range of the parameter values is $0 \le u \le n-k+2$
\item The curve $\vv{p}(u)$ is $C^{k-2}$ continuous
\item $\vv{p}(u)$ is a composite curve made up of (n-k+2) segments
\item Each segment is influenced by $k$ control points
\item A given control point affects upto $k$ segments
\item If the starting and ending control points are the same $\vv{P}^0  = \vv{P}^{n+1}$, then the curve $\vv{p}(u)$ is indeed a closed curve
\end{enumerate}
The form of the NURBS basis function is
\begin{equation}
  N_{k,i}(u) = \frac{(u-t_i) N_{k-1,i}(u)}{t_{k+i-1}-t_i} + \frac{(t_{k+i}-u)N_{k-1,i+1}(u)}{t_{k+i}-t_{i+1}}
\end{equation}
where $t_i$ are the knot values defined as 
\begin{equation}
  t_i =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & i < k\\
    i+1 - k & k \le i \le n \\
    n+2 - k & i > n\\ 
  \end{cases}
\quad \forall i = 0,\ldots, n+k.
\end{equation}
It can be seen that there are a total of $n+k+1$ knot values. We can
implement a function $\texttt{knot\_values(n,k)}$ that computes the
knot values with $n$ and $k$ as inputs. The computed knot values can
be used to compute the basis function $N_{k,i}$ in a recursive manner.
The recursion is terminated when
\begin{equation}
  N_{0,i}(u) = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 & t_i \le u \le t_{i+1}    \\
    0 & \mathrm{otherwise} \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Parametric Representation of Surfaces}

We extend the parametric curves to represent surfaces as
\begin{equation}
  \vv{p}(u_1, u_2) := \dfrac{ {\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} \sum\limits_{j=0}^{m} \alpha_i N_{k,i}(u_1) \beta_j M_{l,j}(u_2) \vv{P}^{i,j}}} {\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} \sum\limits_{j=0}^{m} \alpha_i N_{k,i}(u_1) \beta_j M_{l,j}(u_2)}
\end{equation}
with parameter range $0 \le u_1 \le n - k + 2$ and $0 \le u_2 \le n - l + 2$. 
For ease of notation we define the following form
\begin{equation}
  \vv{p}(\vv{u}) := \dfrac{ {\sum \limits_{s=0}^{n \times m} \alpha_{s} N_{k,s}(\vv{u}) \vv{P}^{s}}} {\sum \limits_{s=0}^{n \times m} \alpha_{s} N_{k,s}(\vv{u})}
\end{equation}

\section{Isogeometric Analysis of Bar}
An elastic bar is suspended vertically and is allowed to deform under
self weight as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bar-setup}. We first consider
the solution of the elastic problem using isogeometric
analysis~\cite{bar-analysis,1D_bar}.
\begin{figure}[h] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{bar-setup.pdf} 
  \caption{\emph{Setup of the deformation of bar problem.}}
  \label{fig:bar-setup}
\end{figure}
The geometry is modeled with information shown in
Table~\ref{tab:bar-problem-parameters} with NURBS basis functions.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Parameters used in geometry modeling of bar.}
  \label{tab:bar-problem-parameters}
  \begin{tabular}{lc}
    \hline
    Parameter & Value \\
    \hline
    degree of basis & 2 \\
    control points  &  [0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0] \\
    knot vector     & [0 0 0 0.5 1 1 1] \\
    number of knot spans & 2 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\subsection{Governing Equation}
The governing equation for the deformation of bar is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar-governing-equation}
  \pd{}{x} \left( EA \pd{u(x)}{x} \right) - \rho g  = 0
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the Young's modulus of material of bar, $A$ is the area
of cross section, $\rho$ is the density of material and $g$ is the
acceleration due to gravity.
\subsection{Solution Form}
Consider the following expansions for the
solution form and its spatial derivative
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar-spectral-expansions}
  u(x) := \sum_{i=1}^{m} R_{i,p}(x) U_i \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad \pd{u(x)}{x} := \sum_{i=1}^{m} \pd{R_{i,p}(x)}{x}  U_i,
\end{equation}
where $R_{i,p}(x)$ are NURBS basis functions and $U_i$ are the control
point displacements. We use the expansions~\eqref{eqn:bar-spectral-expansions} in
the governing equations~\eqref{eqn:bar-governing-equation}. This gives
rise to the following residual
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar-governing-equation}
  R := \pd{}{x} \left( EA  \sum_{i=1}^{m} \pd{R_{i,p}(x)}{x}  U_i \right) - \rho g  = 0.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Galerkin Projection}
The analysis procedure involves the projection of the above residual
onto the basis functions used in the assumed form of solution. This is
represented mathematically as an inner product (projection operation) as
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \left\langle  {\color{black}{R_{j,p}(x)}} \bigg\vert {\color{black}{\pd{}{x} \left[ EA \sum_{i=1}^{m} \pd{R_{i,p}(x)}{x}  U_i  \right]}} \right\rangle  =
  \left\langle  {\color{black}{R_{j,p}(x)}} \bigg\vert {\color{black}{\rho g}} \right\rangle 
\end{equation}
The weak form is obtained using integration by parts as follows
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \begin{gathered}
    \underset{boundary~term}{{{R_{j,p}(x) EA \pd{u(x)}{x}}}  \bigg\vert_{x_a}^{x_b}} +  \underset{stiffness~matrix}{\left\langle {\color{black}{\pd{R_{j,p}(x)}{x}}}  \bigg\vert  {\color{black}{EA  \pd{R_{i,p}(x)}{x}  U_i}}   \right\rangle}  = 
    \underset{force~vector}{\left\langle {\color{black}{R_{j,p}(x)}} \bigg\vert {\color{black}{\rho g}} \right\rangle} \quad \forall j = 1, \ldots,m
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
This gives rise to the following system for each element $x \in [x_a,
  x_b]$
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \setlength\arraycolsep{1.5pt}
                        {EA}
                        \begin{bmatrix}
                          \left \langle {\color{black}{R_1^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_1^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle &  \left \langle {\color{black}{R_1^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_2^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle & \left \langle {\color{black}{R_1^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_m^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle \\
                          \left \langle {\color{black}{R_2^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_1^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle &  \left \langle {\color{black}{R_2^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_2^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle & \left \langle {\color{black}{R_2^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_m^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle \\
                          \left \langle {\color{black}{R_3^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_1^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle &  \left \langle {\color{black}{R_3^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_2^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle & \left \langle {\color{black}{R_3^\prime(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{R_m^\prime(x)}} \right \rangle \\
                        \end{bmatrix}
                        \begin{Bmatrix}
                          U_1 \\
                          U_2 \\
                          U_3 \\
                        \end{Bmatrix}=
                        \begin{Bmatrix}
                          \left \langle {\color{black}{R_1(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{\rho g}} \right \rangle \\
                          \left \langle {\color{black}{R_2(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{\rho g}} \right \rangle \\
                          \left \langle {\color{black}{R_3(x)}} \vert {\color{black}{\rho g}} \right \rangle \\ 
                        \end{Bmatrix}    
\end{equation}
The evaluation of stiffness matrix and force vector requires the NURBS
basis function and its derivatives shown in
Table~\ref{tab:anlytical-form-of-nurbs-functions}
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{NURBS shape functions used in isogeometric analysis.}
  \label{tab:anlytical-form-of-nurbs-functions}
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \hline
    Element 1 & Element 2 \\
    \hline
    $R_1^1(\xi) =  (2 \xi -1)^2$ & $R_1^2(\xi) = (2\xi-2)(\xi-1)$  \\
    $R_2^1(\xi) = -2\xi(3\xi-2)$ & $R_2^2(\xi) = -6\xi^2 + 8\xi -2$ \\
    $R_3^1(\xi) =  2\xi^2$       & $R_3^2(\xi) = (2\xi -1)^2$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
These functions are plotted and visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:nurbs-basis-function-derivatives}.

\subsection{Quadrature and Evaluation of Inner Products}
Evaluation of inner product is done as follows
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \begin{aligned}
    \underset{\text{inner~product}}{\left\langle {\color{black}{f^x(x)}} \big\vert  {\color{black}{g^x(x)}} \right\rangle} &= \underset{\text{integral}}{\int\limits_{x_a}^{x_b}  {\color{black}{f^x(x)}}  {\color{black}{g^x(x)}}~dx} &= \underset{\text{quadrature}}{\sum_{k=1}^M \alpha_k^x  {\color{black}{f^x(x_k)}}  {\color{black}{g^x(x_k)}}}\\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}  
Note that a transformation from $x$ to $\xi$ is required as NURBS
basis is a function of parameter $\xi$. This is achieved using
equations similar to ~\ref{eqn:bar-spectral-expansions}.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/bar-solution.pdf} \\
  \caption{IGA solution and exact solution for the problem.}
  \label{fig:bar-solution}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:bar-solution} we compare the IGA solution with the analytical solution given as
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  u(x) = \frac{\rho g}{E} \left( Lx - \frac{x^2}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
It can be seen that the IGA solution with two elements produces the
exact solution.

\section{Isogeometric Analysis of Plate}
An infinite plate of L=8 and W=8 with a circular hole subjected to in-plane concentrated load at one of the control points. The material properties were taken as $E = 10^3$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu =0.3$
\begin{figure}[h] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/plate1.PNG} 
  \caption{\emph{Setup of the deformation of plate problem.}}
  \label{fig:plate-setup}
\end{figure}
The geometry can be simplified to a quarter plate due to its symmetry. It is modeled using NURBS with 12 control points. For this plate with a circular hole problem, the order of the basis function is chosen as p=2 and q=2. Therefore, the total of number of active control points and the basis functions in an element are 9. The number of control points along $\xi$ direction is given by $n_{cp}(\xi)$ = Total number of knots-(p+1) = 4 and the number of control points along $\eta$ direction is given by $n_{cp}(\eta)$ = Total number of knots in $\eta$ direction-(q+1) = 3. The geometry is divided into two elements with each having 9 active control points. 
\begin{figure}[h] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/plate2.png} 
  \caption{\emph{Quarter model of the plate with circular hole.}}
  \label{fig:plate-setup}
\end{figure}
The geometry of the NURBS discretized element $\Omega^e$ is given by the combination of the basis function $R_i$ and the control point variable $P_i$ as
\begin{equation}\nonumber
    x^e = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{cp}^e} R_iP_i
\end{equation}
and using Galerkin approach, the solution field is given by,
\begin{equation}\nonumber
    u^e = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{cp}^e}R_iu_i
\end{equation}
The NURBS basis function and its derivatives are evaluated to obtain the strain-displacement matrix,
    \begin{equation*}
        B=\begin{bmatrix}
        R_{1,x} & 0 & R_{2,x} & 0 & \dots & R_{9,x} & 0\\
        0 & R_{1,y} & 0 &R_{2,y} & \dots & 0 & R_{9,y}\\
        R_{1,y} & 0 &R_{1,x} &  R_{2,y} & \dots &  R_{9,y} &R_{9,x}
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
The strain displacement matrix is then used to evaluate the element stiffness matrix and force vector using the weak formulation. The weak formulation is given by,
\begin{equation*}
        \int_{\Omega^e} (B^TCB  \,d\Omega)\,u = \int_{\Gamma^e_t} R.t \,d\Gamma +\int_{\Omega^e} R.f \,d\Omega
    \end{equation*}
Like FEM, IGA discretized weak form, can also be cast into the standard matrix form as
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{e=1}^{nel}[K^eU^e=F^e]
\end{equation*}
which in global form can be written as 
\begin{equation}
    K^GU^{cp}=F^G
\end{equation}\label{Global}
where $K^e$, $F^e$ and $U^e$ denote the NURBS described iso-geometric element's stiffness matrix, external force vector, and displacement vector, respectively. The procedure to assemble the global matrices are similar to assembly procedure of FEA but it uses control point assembly array instead of nodal connectivity matrix.\\
Using the global stiffness matrix and force vectors into the global form to obtain the displacements of the control points. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth,height=.9\textwidth]{figures/undeformed_plate.png}

  \captionof{figure}{Deformed Plate}
  \label{fig:test2}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The displacements of the control points are then added to the original control points to obtain the new control points. The new control points are then used to plot the deformed plate. These displacement values can be used to find the stresses and strains in the model.

\section{Conclusions}
B-spline basis function has unique properties like local support exact
geometry representation and refinement technique. IGA analysis
framework makes use of these NURBS properties. It is observed that the
displacement solution obtained from IGA is equivalent to control
points of B-spline displacement curve. Coupling of CAD and analysis
solvers reduces the burden of mesh regeneration. This minimizes the
computational cost. Utilizing the exact geometry in analysis provide
accurate results than FEA. Also, IGA gives better solution per degree
of freedom than FEM.  IGA has many advantages over FEM, but also has
some disadvantages of its own. IGA is a NURBS based method, analysts
must require a lot of CAD knowledge. Multi-patch B-spline modeling of
intricate shapes is a very difficult task. Irrespective of the degree
of the basis function and number of elements, the FEM solution at
nodes always gives exact solution. But, that is not the case in IGA,
because of non-interpolation of B-spline control points.
The future work entails the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The visualization of quantities such as stresses and strains
      are not straight forward compared to conventional finite element
      analysis
    \item The mesh refinement process with a knot insertion algorithm
      to extend it for any number of elements during analysis
    \item The application of IGA for 3D problems and complex geometries.
\end{itemize}
